Saved search:
saved search is a powerful tool used to query and report on data stored within the system. 
Saved searches allow users to define criteria and filters to extract specific information 
from NetSuite records, such as transactions, customers, items, or any other type of data.
Usereventscript:(1000)
-->It runs on server side and perform events such as record creation,updation or delete.
entrypoints:
.beforesubmit:Executes before a record is submitted to the database. This is typically used for data validation and modification of the record's values.
.beforeload:Executes before a record is loaded. Useful for modifying record form, adding buttons, or setting default values.
.aftersubmit: Executes after a record has been submitted to the database. Ideal for processes that need to run after the record is saved, like sending notifications or creating related records.
client:(1000)
-->Runs in browser side and customize froms,lists and fields.
(10)lineinit,fieldchange,pageinit,saverecord
postsourcing:executes on transaction form when a field that sources the information from another field modified.
sublistchanged:execute after sublist has been inserted,removed,edited.
validatefield:execute when a field about changed by user or client side call
delete:execute when removing the exisitng line from edit sublist.
insert:execute when you insert a line an edit sublist.
line:execute before line is added inline editor sublist or editor sublist
suitlet:(1000)
-->serverside used to create user interface and web applications.
onrequest:you can process incoming requests, retrieve necessary data, perform operations, and 
generate appropriate responses in Suitelet scripts.
scheduled:10000
-->Runs on server side on specific schedule(every hour or everydy)
-->Scheduled Scripts are used for executing tasks that need to be performed at regular intervals or at a specific time,
 such as processing large batches of records, 
performing data imports/exports, or executing periodic calculations.
execute:This function is automatically called by the system at the scheduled time or interval specified 
during deployment
Difference between Schedule and Map/reduce script:
    Parallel Processing: Map/Reduce Scripts allow for parallel processing of data, making them more efficient for large datasets, 
    while Scheduled Scripts process data sequentially.
    Execution Structure: Map/Reduce has a structured multi-stage process (Get Input Data, Map, Reduce, Summarize), whereas 
    Scheduled Scripts execute as a single script without such stages.
    Governance Handling: Map/Reduce is more governance-friendly when dealing with large datasets due to its ability to 
    break down the data and process it in batches.

 -->Scheduled Scripts for simpler, time-based tasks and Map/Reduce Scripts for complex, 
 large-scale data processing where efficiency and scalability are critical.
 -->Scheduled Scripts execute as a single script without such stages.
 -->Scheduled Scripts process data sequentially.

map/reduce script:(10,000)
-->it handles large amount of data and runs in serverside.
-->Map/Reduce Scripts are designed for processing large datasets efficiently by breaking them into smaller chunks (batches) and 
processing them in parallel. They are ideal for tasks like bulk processing of records, data transformations, and 
integrations that involve large data sets.entrypoints:getinputdata:10,000 units of API usage,60 minutes of time,1B of instructions,
map:1,000 units of API usage,5 minutes of time,100M of instructions,
reduce:The reduce function is executed only once and is typically used for aggregating 
or summarizing the data processed by the map tasks.5,000 units of API usage,15 minutes of time,100M of instructions
summarize:function is typically used to generate the final output or result of the Map/Reduce script.
It provides a way to consolidate and present the processed data in a meaningful and actionable format.10,000 units of API usage
,60 minutes of time,1B of instructions
Restlet:(5000)
-->its an api and perform any funtions that implement suitescript.
-->its an suitescript that executes called by external application or by script.
post: such as creating a NetSuite record.
put:such as inserting/upserting a NetSuite record. 
get:such as retrieving a NetSuite record.
delete:such as deleting a NetSuite record.
Workflowactionscript:(1,000)
-->WorkflowActionScript is a type of SuiteScript used in Oracle NetSuite to create custom actions within workflows. 
 WorkflowActionScript is the 'onAction' function, which is triggered when the custom action is executed within the workflow.

 Difference between suitescript 1.0 and 2.0

SuiteScript 1.0: Best for simpler, smaller scripts with a straightforward procedural approach. Easier to get started with for basic tasks.
SuiteScript 2.0: Preferred for modern, large-scale, and complex applications. Offers a modular approach, better performance, enhanced features, and modern JavaScript support.
SuiteScript 1.0: Non-modular, all functions are globally accessible.
SuiteScript 2.0: Modular, uses define and require to load specific modules.
SuiteScript 1.0: Basic try-catch error handling.
SuiteScript 2.0: Enhanced error handling with detailed error objects.
SuiteScript 1.0: Less optimized for large-scale operations.
SuiteScript 2.0: Built for better performance and scalability.
SuiteScript 1.0: Limited API.
SuiteScript 2.0: More extensive and feature-rich API.
Difference between module and API?
module:
A module in NetSuite refers to a specific functional area or suite of related features within the platform. NetSuite offers various modules, each designed to address different aspects of business operations.
Financial Management: Includes features for accounting, financial reporting, and billing.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Manages customer interactions, sales processes, and marketing campaigns.
APi:
An API in NetSuite provides a set of protocols and tools that allow developers to interact programmatically with the NetSuite platform. NetSuite offers various APIs, such as:
SuiteTalk(SOAP,REstful),Suitescript,Restlet.
Module: In SuiteScript 2.0, modules like N/record, N/search, and N/email are loaded using require or define. 
These modules provide specific functionalities (e.g., creating records, performing searches) that you can use in your scripts.
API: In SuiteScript, the API refers to the functions and methods provided by NetSuite that you can use to interact with the platform. 
For example, record.create() is part of the SuiteScript API, allowing you to create a new record.
SuiteBuilder:Custom Roles,lists,fields,lists,forms,custom records,tabs,centers.

HTMl template:
In Oracle NetSuite, HTML templates are used to design and format the content of emails, printed forms, or 
other documents generated within the system. These templates leverage HTML, CSS, and a set of 
NetSuite-specific tags and syntax to create customizable and dynamic documents that can pull in data from 
NetSuite records.
