 Difference between suitescript 1.0 and 2.0

SuiteScript 1.0: Best for simpler, smaller scripts with a straightforward procedural approach. Easier to get started with for basic tasks.
SuiteScript 2.0: Preferred for modern, large-scale, and complex applications. Offers a modular approach, better performance, enhanced features, and modern JavaScript support.
